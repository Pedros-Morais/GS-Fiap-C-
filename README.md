# BlackoutGuard - Power Grid Cybersecurity System

## Project Overview
BlackoutGuard is a comprehensive cybersecurity solution designed to protect power grid infrastructure from cyber attacks and monitor for vulnerabilities that could lead to power outages. The system provides real-time monitoring, threat detection, incident response capabilities, and analytical tools to help utilities maintain grid stability and security.

## Problem Statement
Power grids are increasingly targeted by sophisticated cyber attacks that can cause widespread blackouts, infrastructure damage, and public safety risks. Traditional security systems are often reactive and lack specialized tools to address the unique challenges of power grid cybersecurity. BlackoutGuard fills this gap by providing a specialized solution for monitoring, detecting, and responding to cyber threats in power grid environments.

## Key Features
1. **User Authentication** - Secure login system for authorized personnel
2. **Threat Monitoring** - Real-time monitoring of potential cyber threats to grid infrastructure
3. **Incident Management** - Track and respond to security incidents and power outages
4. **Vulnerability Assessment** - Scan and identify security vulnerabilities in grid systems
5. **Alert Generation** - Customizable alerts for potential threats and outages
6. **Reporting System** - Generate comprehensive reports on security status and incidents
7. **Audit Logging** - Detailed logs of all system activities and security events

## Technical Architecture
- **Language**: C# (.NET 9.0)
- **Application Type**: Console Application (can be extended to web/GUI)
- **Design Pattern**: Object-Oriented with SOLID principles
- **Data Storage**: File-based storage (JSON)

## System Requirements
- .NET 9.0 Runtime
- Windows/macOS/Linux operating system

## Installation Instructions
1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/BlackoutGuard.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd BlackoutGuard
   ```
3. Build the project:
   ```
   dotnet build
   ```
4. Run the application:
   ```
   dotnet run
   ```

```

## Business Rules
1. All users must authenticate before accessing system features
2. Critical alerts must be acknowledged within a configurable timeframe
3. Vulnerability assessments must be performed at regular intervals
4. All security incidents must be logged with timestamp and severity level
5. Regular backups of system data must be maintained
6. Reports must be generated on a scheduled basis

## Future Enhancements
- Integration with SCADA systems
- Machine learning-based threat prediction
- Mobile application for alerts on the go
- Integration with physical security systems
